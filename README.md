Hey! 

Thanks for taking the time to look at my front-end vanilla JS to-do app. I wanted to write this README file to explain how to set this up. It's quite simple. 

You'll want to use the VS code extension Live Share to run it. Go ahead and checkout the VS Code Marketplace. 

I typically right click index files and then on "Live Share." 

Hope to hear from you soon!
Michael
